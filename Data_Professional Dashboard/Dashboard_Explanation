I successfully created my second Power BI dashboard, "Data Professional Analytics Dashboard"!!

This project has been a thrilling adventure in data analysis, from collecting data to the final interactive visualization.📊

Here is a description of the procedure:

1️⃣Data Collection: I started by collecting data from sources, ensuring it was accurate and comprehensive.

2️⃣Dataset Preparation: I manually cleaned and enhanced the data using Power Query Editor to make it appropriate for analysis.

3️⃣Visualization: I created several distinct visuals for Power View, such as:

🎯Key performance indicators (KPIs): are used to monitor important parameters. 
<br>
📉Area Chart: This visual representation of trend changes over time can be used to draw consumers' attention to the total changes across all trends. 
<br>
📊Bar Chart: Comparing data between categories using a bar chart. 
<br>
▶️Gauge: It allows you to quickly inspect data and make informed decisions. The gauge visual can be used on its own or in combination with other 
visualizations. 
<br>
🍩Donut Chart: It gives data distribution a fresh perspective. 
<br>
🗺️Treemaps: These show nested rectangles of hierarchical data. 
<br>

4️⃣Insight Generation: These visuals aren't just for show; they're also powerful tools for producing conclusions.
